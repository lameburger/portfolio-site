Ladies and Gentlemen, let me tell you about my latest creation, a website that's going to change the way we view each other at our school. It's a statistical analysis of the entire female student body, based solely on physical appearance, using the ELO system of rating.

I wanted to challenge the status quo, to shake things up and create something that would get people talking. I was tired of the mundane and I wanted to do something bold and daring. What could be bolder than ranking the physical appearance of every girl in our school, using a scientifically proven method of rating? The ELO system, used in chess, objectively ranks players based on their performance. I applied it to the female student body, taking into account not just the number of votes each girl receives, but also the relative strength of the other girls. This ensures the rankings are accurate, unbiased, and reflect the constantly changing opinions of the student body.

Imagine comparing yourself with your peers and friends, seeing where you stand in the school, and using it as a way to improve. The website provides a complete picture of the school's physical appearance hierarchy, from number one to the bottom. But it's not just a simple arbitrary number assigned to each girl. The website uses the ELO system, where girls are ranked based on a side-by-side comparison giving the whole thing a Turing-like feel. This makes the rankings more implicit and accurate, as opposed to just manually clicking on girls you find attractive or assigning an arbitrary value to a girl that pops up. It's a tool that can spark healthy competition and discussions.

Now, I know some may say this is sexist or cruel, but let's be real, everyone talks about who's hot and who's not. So why not make it official? Why not turn the subjective into something objective? I hacked into the school's database, grabbed all the photos of the girls, and put them up for judgment. It took me less than 24 hours to compromise the school's security and get the website up and running.

To the guys, enjoy the website and the fun of seeing the results. To the ladies, find out where you stand in the school's hierarchy of physical appearance. Who knows, it might even spark some healthy debates and arguments.

This website is about challenging the status quo and pushing boundaries. It's about making a statement and I hope that statement will be heard loud and clear. It's about finding out the rankings of the hottest to not-so-hot girls at our school and the chaos that may ensue. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.
