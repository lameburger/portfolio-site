          <p>a computer hardware business ran out of my basement. began by sourcing hardware from various recyclers, auctions, liquidation platforms, and local buyers. lately, my main goal for the business has been moving the focal point of sales to online buyers through selling platforms, but will ultimately develop a byte box ecom store. </p>

          <p>if you're not familiar with stenography and stenographic machines, the biggest takeaway you should know is their cost-to-entry (thousands). seriously, people go to college just to learn how to type on these things. after learning about this, I decided to try and develop a steno keyboard of my own (shown above). after developing one for less than $15 with my own circuitboard and open-source code, I began a kickstarter campaign that sadly failed due to other (better) competition. nonetheless, learning about the intricacies of keyboard development was worth it.</p>

          <h2>YouTube Channel (may 2020 - present)</h2>
          <p>over the past 3ish years, I have been uploading videos to my yt channel. I began by doing computer part reviews and pc tutorials, which was actually quite successfull totalling almost 1 million views from those vieos alone (+ ad revenue/affiliates). however, part reviews are one of the most boring video types to make so I moved towards fun applications of cs. sadly, they aren't getting as many views, but hey they are much less dehumanizing to make!</p>
